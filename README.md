Differences between SASS and SCSS

- compiling the .sass and .scss files produce the exact output but there is only difference in the syntax.
- .scss syntax closely resembles to .css syntax with ; and {} for selectors.
- .sass syntax doesn't care about ; or { }.
- indentation is very important in .sass, if not indented properly will lead to errors.
